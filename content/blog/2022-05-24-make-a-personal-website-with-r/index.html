<p>Having a personal website is so cool and it is too slow to update a blog on other websites such as Sina Blog.And These are the two main reasons for me to create my personal blog website.</p>
<p>Tool:</p>
<p>1.RStudio: RStudio is a development environment base on R where we make changes to code </p>
<p>2.Hugo: This is a website for people to create web layouts and there are many different themes so we don’t have to write the source code for the web layout by ourselves. </p>
<p>3.GitHub: When we made changes, we want to be able to track them. And that’s why need GitHub, a version control system. </p>
<p>4.Netlify: a website can create a domain name and host the website like creating a road to tell people how to go to your house. When Github gets informed of the change we made, it will also inform the website held by Netlify.</p>
<p>Steps: </p>
<p>1.Download the blogdown package in your Rstudio. The blogdown package is a manual written by YiHui Xie to tell R how to create a website. </p>
<p>2.install Hugo and your selected theme from Hugo in Rstudio.</p>
<p>3.Create a repository with GitHub used to relate to your code file. Once you made something changes you can just upload it to GitHub.</p>
<p>4.Deploy the network with Netlify using the repository on GitHub </p>
<p>5.Modify and write your website content in RStudio</p>
<p>We can also combine any type of file on the website. For example, I put a png file, a word document file, and a URL of my Google site. Among them, static files such as pictures and documents need to be placed in the corresponding folder. I got stuck in this step for a long time and couldn’t find the corresponding folder.Fortunately, static files are usually kept in one folder, so we may put all our static files into that folder.</p>
